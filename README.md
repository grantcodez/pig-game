<h1>Pig game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Turn Basics: On a playerâ€™s turn, they roll a single six-sided die repeatedly, adding the results to their turn score.

Scoring: If a player rolls anything but a 1, they add the rolled number to their turn score. They can choose to "hold" at any time during their turn, which means they stop rolling and add their turn score to their total score.

Rolling a 1: If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends. Their total score remains unchanged.

Winning: The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds the target score. That player is declared the winner.
